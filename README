Dotfiles is a tool to manage config files in your homedir across several
computers.

See the top of the script ("dotfiles") for documentation.

Tested with python 2.7 on Ubuntu 12.04.

Might work with python 2.4.



BUGS:
* Does not handle directories (e.g. ~/.emacs-lisp/) quite right.



TODO:
* Add support for config variations on different computers.
